1. Unzip the folder and open the files in your desired IDE 
3. Run npm install (be sure to run it in the SAME directory as the package.json file)
4. You can do npm run app to launch the server or you can run the server in dev mode (which means you can make changes to the code without starting and stopping your code constantly) using npm run dev 

Notes:
- restaurant.txt is created upon launching server 
- OrderStats.txt created when you submit an order 

Design Decisions 
- this program was designed using the information that was presented in class and the tutorials 
- the program was designed similar to the Template Engine Code that was demoed in class 
- this code leveraged the template engine pug and uses npm install
