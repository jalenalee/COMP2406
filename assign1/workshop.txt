Routing 
- Reference a file you might get 404 not found
- Reference javascript in one of three ways: 
try to put your javascript in javascript folder 
1) <script src="a1.js"></script>
- relative to current directory you loaded file in 
2) <script src="/a1.js"></script>
- go to computer home directory to find it 

- when in doubt, use a div ! add lots of divs !


when creating element, ask yourself what are you creating this for: 
- use id because it's unique (only call THAT element)
- if you're going to do something to a GROUP, give it a class
